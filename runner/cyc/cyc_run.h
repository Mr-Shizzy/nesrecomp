/*
 * cyc_run.h - frame scheduling between recompiled code and the interpreter.
 *
 * Whenever the CPU is between instructions at an address the recompiler
 * compiled, the native code runs; everything else (RAM code, open bus,
 * addresses discovery missed) runs on the interpreter generated from the same
 * templates (cpu6502_interp.c).
 *
 * A frame ends at the first instruction boundary at or after the PPU reports
 * the frame's VBlank. Recompiled code can only yield at instruction
 * boundaries, so native, --interp-only and oracle runs all use that rule and
 * stay comparable cycle for cycle.
