/*
 * cyc_state.h - the machine's state as a whole: save states, and the
 * snapshot a mod's isolated routine call is undone with (cyc_mod.h).
 *
 * A save state is the complete machine at a frame boundary - CPU, CPU RAM,
 * the cartridge (registers, work RAM, CHR RAM, mapper chips), PPU (with the
 * picture it just drew and what cyc_render.h captured of it), APU, and on
 * the FDS the drive, the disk as the game has written it and the HLE tier -
 * then the host's own section (cyc_state_set_host: the frame counter, the
 * Disk action) and one record per mod that keeps state of its own
 * (runner/include/mod_savestate.h). Loading validates everything first (the
 * program, the disk image, the FDS options, every section's size, each mod's
 * validator) and changes nothing unless it can apply all of it; compiled RAM
 * views are re-validated from RAM afterwards (they start UNKNOWN, as at
 * power-on), which is correct by construction.
 *
 * A state belongs to the executable that wrote it: the file records the
 * compiled program's identity and the size of every machine structure, and a
 * load refuses any difference. A run loaded from a state at frame N and one
 * that ran through frame N from power-on are the same machine: every later
 * --hash-out line matches (tools/cyc/test_cyc_state.py).
 *
 * Audio output filters and host presentation are not machine state and are
 * not saved (VRC7's sound chip, audio only, restarts from its registers).
