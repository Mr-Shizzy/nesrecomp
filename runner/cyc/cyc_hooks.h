/*
 * cyc_hooks.h - trusted mod callbacks at the program's hook sites.
 *
 * A game declares the sites in game.toml:
 *
 *     [[mod_function_hook]]
 *     id    = "smb2j.widescreen.area-parser"   # the plugin that registers here
 *     addr  = 0x9123
 *     bytes = "A5 0E 48 20"                    # the code that must be there
 *
 * and a statically linked plugin registers a callback for that id with
 * runner/include/mod_function_hooks.h (nes_mod_register_function_entry_plugin),
 * disabled until its mod activates it. The recompiler compiles each site as
 * an instruction boundary that returns to the scheduler while any hook is
 * enabled (cyc_hook_stop below; a program without sites compiles nothing).
 * The scheduler (cyc_run.c) then runs the enabled callbacks of the sites at
 * cpu.pc whose `bytes` memory holds right now - the content key is what makes
 * a site in RAM mean one routine: an FDS program loads different files at the
 * same address - and dispatches the instruction as usual. The same happens
 * before an interpreted instruction, so recompiled code, RAM views and the
 * interpreter all fire a site identically.
 *
 * A callback runs at the instruction boundary, before the site's opcode fetch,
 * with the machine exactly as the program left it (cyc_mod.h reads and writes
 * it, and can run the program's own routines in isolation). No site fires
 * while an interrupt is about to be taken there: the program is not entering
 * the site's instruction yet, and the site fires when it does (after RTI).
 *
 * Returning nonzero means the callback handled the routine: the site must be
 * a subroutine entry, and the scheduler returns from it the way its RTS would
 * (pull the return address, continue after the JSR), without the RTS's bus
 * cycles. Zero runs the original instruction.
 *
 * A plugin registered for an id (or, without one, an address) that no site of
 * this program declares is a build error, refused loudly at start
 * (cyc_hooks_validate). Every site keeps counts (fired, handled, content
 * mismatches), and a frame in which a site fired leaves a MOD_HOOK ring event.
