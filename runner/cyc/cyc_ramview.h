/*
 * cyc_ramview.h - compiled views of code in RAM (see cyc_recomp.h CycRamView).
 *
 * Code a program runs from RAM (a disk file the FDS BIOS loaded, a routine it
 * copied) is compiled ahead of time from every image of RAM the compiler
 * knows: the disk's files at their load addresses, and snapshots a run
 * captured (--capture-log, game.toml [game] cycle_capture_file). A view folds
 * only its own instruction bytes. It is entered only while RAM holds them:
 *
 *   - every view starts UNKNOWN at power-on; the first dispatch to one of its
 *     instruction starts compares its dependency bytes with RAM and marks it
 *     VALID or INVALID;
 *   - the write watch (hw_code_watch) sees every store to a byte some view
 *     folds. A store that changes it demotes the views folding it to UNKNOWN
 *     (a VALID one also sets cyc_ram_code_dirty, which ends the running
 *     block after that store). Stores to bytes no view folds, such as
 *     variables next to code, cost one table load and change nothing;
 *   - an address no VALID view starts an instruction at runs on the
 *     interpreter, which is correct by construction, and is captured for the
 *     next compile when capturing.
 *
 * Everything here observes the machine; nothing changes what it does, so
 * native, --interp-only and cyc_interp runs stay identical cycle for cycle.
